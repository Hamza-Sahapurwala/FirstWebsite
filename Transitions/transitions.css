/* ! CSS Transistions */

/* * If we want to make any transitions, like from 1 shape to another or 1 colour to another, css transitions are used */

.circle{
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  background-color: magenta;
  transition: background-color 3s 1s, border-radius 3s 1s; /* * We can set for 2 different things */
}

.circle:hover{
  background-color: cyan;
  border-radius: 50%;
}

/* * Now if we want to transition from square to circle in a proper manner, we use the transition property */

/* * We can set the time needed to transition and specify which property which will be affected */

/* * Syntax : Transition: property-name duration delay */

/* * Delay tells how much time to wait until the transition starts */

/* * transition-timing-function: ease-in/ease-out and other stuff you can find on easings.net */
