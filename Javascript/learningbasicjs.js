console.log("Hello World"); // ! This is the print statement of Javascript

// * console.log's will go to the next line and then print their statements

// ! Number Data Type

// * The number data type can store all the types of numbers like +,- & floating numbers

// * This data type can store all the things, so there is no other data types like double and float (as they are in C)

console.log(40+15, 2/5, 8*2, 2-5, 4%2, 3 ** 2); // * It prints: 55 0.4 16 -3 0 9

// * PEMDAS - Parenthesis Exponent Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction (Highest Precedence to the Left and Lowest Precedence to the Right)

// * That is the rule followed by Javascript when doing numerical operations

// ! NaN - Not a Number

// * It's the value when concepts like infinity comes into play

// * It is still considered as part of the Number data type

// * Any operations with NaN will return NaN

console.log(0/0, 1 + NaN); // * These operations return the value NaN
