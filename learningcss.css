/* * This is a css file
* CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
* Let's do something to show css works
*/

/* * The tag name like h1,a,br is needed to style them using CSS */

/* ! Color Attribute */

/* * Assigns colour to the text available */

/* ! Background-Color Attribute */

/* * Assigns only colour to the background of the given text block */

/* ! Different ways of using colours in CSS */

/* ! RGB(redvalue, greenvalue, bluevalue) */

/* * There are 140 named colours, which are very limited */

/* * To access other colours we use rgb(redvalue, greenvalue, bluevalue) */

/* * Each value can go b/w 0-255 both inclusive */

/* * This helps to tune which colour we want specifically */

/* * We can the values for the colour we want using colour picker/pallettes online */

/* * It's an additive colour system */

/* ! Hexadecimal System */

/* * By  using the hexadecimal system, colours are assigned some value, which helps us pick us the shade of colour we want */

/* * The syntax is: #000000 (This is black)*/

/* * The first two characters after # is for the red, the next two for green and last two for blue */

/* ? Protip: if the same characters are repeating(#000000), it can be shorten down to #000 and it can be applied to any hexcolour code which has repeating characters for a particular colour channel */

/* * Same as with rgb, use colour picker/pallettes online for choosing any specific colour */

/* * And it's additive colour system too */

/* ! Text Align */

/* * It tells the text where it should be */

/* * The nuance is that the text will be aligned on the space given to the said element block, not on the webpage itself */

/* * We can alter how much space is given to each tag to use text-align more efficiently */

/* ! Font Weight */

/* * Basically, we can set the text to bold, bolder or normal using those keywords and no. */

/* * normal = 400 */

/* ! Text Decoration */

/* * It helps us puts underline, overline, line-through and stuff */

/* * We can also specify the colour of the line and the style of the line */

/* * Can be used to remove the default underlines in anchor tags */

/* * Syntax: text-decoration: [colour(default is black)] underline [wavy, dotted, etc.]; */

/* ! Line-Height */

/* * Adds extra space b/w lines of text */

/* * The no. given is multiplies by the font size of the text to give the appropriate line space */

/* ! Letter-Spacing */

/* * Adds space inbetween the characters of the letters */

/* ! Font Size */

/* * We can set the font size of the text */

/* * The font can be set by either absolute units(pixels, cm, in(inches), etc) or by relative units(em, rem, vh, vw, etc) */

/* * Pixel is used everywhere and 1px for anything is same as the 1px of any other thing but it's not good for responsive sites as pixel size changes in each website */

h1{
    color: #0FF; /* * Can be expanded to #00FFFF */

    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); /* * This gives us black */

    text-align: center; /* * All the h1 tag texts are put in the centre */

    text-decoration: gray underline solid;
}

/* *  We see that all the h1 tags turn to aqua, that means our css is linked! */

button{
    font-weight: bolder; /* * Makes the text inside the button bolder */

    color: magenta; /* * The text in the button changes the colours*/
}

p{
    line-height: 1;

    /* letter-spacing: 10px; */

    /* font-size: 0px; */
}
