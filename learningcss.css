/* * This is a css file
* CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
* Let's do something to show css works
*/

/* * The tag name like h1,a,br is needed to style them using CSS */

/* ! Color Attribute */

/* * Assigns colour to the text available */

/* ! Background-Color Attribute */

/* * Assigns only colour to the background of the given text block */

/* ! Different ways of using colours in CSS */

/* ! RGB(redvalue, greenvalue, bluevalue) */

/* * There are 140 named colours, which are very limited */

/* * To access other colours we use rgb(redvalue, greenvalue, bluevalue) */

/* * Each value can go b/w 0-255 both inclusive */

/* * This helps to tune which colour we want specifically */

/* * We can the values for the colour we want using colour picker/pallettes online */

/* * It's an additive colour system */

/* ! Hexadecimal System */

/* * By  using the hexadecimal system, colours are assigned some value, which helps us pick us the shade of colour we want */

/* * The syntax is: #000000 (This is black)*/

/* * The first two characters after # is for the red, the next two for green and last two for blue */

/* ? Protip: if the same characters are repeating(#000000), it can be shorten down to #000 and it can be applied to any hexcolour code which has repeating characters for a particular colour channel */

/* * Same as with rgb, use colour picker/pallettes online for choosing any specific colour */

/* * And it's additive colour system too */

/* ! Text Align */

/* * It tells the text where it should be */

/* * The nuance is that the text will be aligned on the space given to the said element block, not on the webpage itself */

/* * We can alter how much space is given to each tag to use text-align more efficiently */

h1{
    color: #0FF; /* * Can be expanded to #00FFFF */

    background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); /* * This gives us black */

    text-align: center; /* * All the h1 tag texts are put in the centre */
}

/* *  We see that all the h1 tags turn to aqua, that means our css is linked! */

button{
    color: magenta; /* * The text in the button changes the colours*/
}
