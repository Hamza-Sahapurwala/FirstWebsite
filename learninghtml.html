<!-- * The other header tags are to be used for subheading and such -->

<!-- * The Doctype and html tags with the head and body tags are all boilerplate html(code which is repeated no matter the program) -->

<!-- * we can access the boilerplate in vsc by writing ! and hitting enter which will save us time to write the boilerplate code -->

            <!-- * In HTML code, we can't use div again and again for everything as they make accesibility i.e. screen readers and ourselves will not know what is what -->

            <!-- * So we have stuff like main,article,section,header,footer,nav,etc. which acts like a div but their names tell their purpose -->

            <!-- * This makes it easier for screen readers and other developers to know what tag they have to go to edit any particular thing and not just do through so many divs -->

            <!-- * Semantic means Meaningful -->
