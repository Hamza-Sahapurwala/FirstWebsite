<!-- * The Doctype and html tags with the head and body tags are all boilerplate html(code which is repeated no matter the program) -->

<!-- * we can access the boilerplate in vsc by writing ! and hitting enter which will save us time to write the boilerplate code -->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- ! * This tells that we are using HTML5 -->

<html> <!-- ! Root Element which contains everything else (contains only 1 head tag and 1 body tag) -->

        <h5>Smallest</h5> <!-- * They are the headings under which p tags are used -->

        <!-- ! Lists -->

        <!-- * 2 types of lists in HTML: Unordered(Bullet Points) & Ordered(Numbered) Lists -->

        <!-- * Those lists have the same children tags such as li, script and template -->

        <!-- ! Unordered Lists -->

        <ul> <!-- * unordered list -->

            <li>First</li> <!-- * li = list item (Mandatory for lists) -->

            <li>Second</li>

        <!-- ! Anchor Tags -->

        <!-- * They holds links to go to other webpages or websites -->

        <!-- * They don't create a new line of their own as they fit in the line(Like the clickable words we see on wikipedia) -->

        <!-- * We can use href to refer to other html files we have on the local system -->

        <!-- * href = hypertext reference -->

        <a href="https://www.google.com">Link to Google</a>

        <!-- * The href attribute contains the link to go to the website -->

        <!-- * For a link of a website on the internet, we need to include the https protocal -->

        <!-- * Else just writing google.com, it searches for a file of the same name on the local system -->

        <!-- ! Images in HTML -->

        <!-- * We can add images to html using image tag -->        

        <!-- * img tag doesn't have it's complementary closing tag -->

        <img src="cat.png" alt="It's a cat pic">

        <!-- * src = source : tells us where the image is present and presents that in the webpage(we can use images over the internet by copying their links over the internet) -->

        <!-- * alt = alternate : If the image doesn't load, the text will be shown which describes the pic(also used by screen readers) -->
         
        <!-- ! Div Tags -->

        <!-- * Div or Content Divider is used for grouping together tags in a separate block -->

        <!-- * div is used a lot for css -->

        <!-- * div is a block element -->

        <!-- * that's why it takes a whole block to itself to fit all the tags it it -->

        <div>

            <p>In a div block</p>

            <p>All the tags here can be brought together properly using css</p>
            
            <img src="cat.png" alt="same cat">
            
        </div>
        
        <a href="nothinghere">Everthing is in a block when looking at the Inspector tools</a>

        <!-- * The img is in another block and doesn't allow anchor tag to be in the same line because it's in a div -->

        <!-- * If anchor tag and img were in the same line, the anchor tag would continue directly after the img, which we don't want -->

        <!-- ! Span Tags -->

        <!-- * In line element -->

        <!-- * Used to specify or single out content present in other tags so that we can style it in CSS -->

        <p>Hello, this is <span>span</span></p>

        <!-- * Nothing changes to the word span as we have not linked it to any css file yet -->

        <!-- ! HR Tags -->

        <!-- * HR = horizontal rule = just adds a line to seperate stuff -->

        <!-- * Doesn't have a closing tag -->

        <h1>For Example</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>The above line can be styled using CSS later</p>

        <!-- ! BR Tags -->

        <!-- * BR = break = justs breaks the content, forcing it to the next line -->

        <!-- * Doesn't have any closing tag -->

        <p>Well<br>It<br>is<br>what<br>it<br>is</p>

        <!-- ! Sup tags -->

        <!-- * sup = superscript = used for pushing specified content above the baseline -->

        <p>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></p>
